# 📡FusionPBX-4.5.29 Remote Code Execution RCE Authenticated📡 
Remote code execution (RCE) is a class of software security flaws/vulnerabilities. RCE vulnerabilities will allow a malicious actor to execute any code of their choice on a remote machine over LAN, WAN, or internet

Remote code execution is a cyber-attack whereby an attacker can remotely execute commands on someone else’s computing device. Remote code executions (RCEs) usually occur due to malicious malware downloaded by the host and can happen regardless of the device’s geographic location. Remote Code Execution (RCE) is also referred to as Remote Code Evaluation. 

A remote control execution is a broad category of cyber attack technique. It allows a threat actor to execute this remote code on a target machine across the internet, wide area network (WAN), or local area network (LAN). For example, a threat actor in Ukraine could silently place malicious code on a targeted device in the United States. Additionally, RCE enables a threat actor to control a computer or server by executing malicious software. RCE can, of course, lead to the complete takeover of a targeted vulnerable application. 

Execution of an RCE attack sequence is pretty basic. First, the threat actor scans computers across the internet seeking known vulnerabilities that may support a successful attack. Once a targeted vulnerability is identified, the threat actor then performs the exploit to gain access. Now that they are in, they can execute the malicious code to reach their goals, including exfiltrating data, diverting funds, performing detailed surveillance, and disrupting service.
